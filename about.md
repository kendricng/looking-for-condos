### Who Am I
Hey y'all. My name is Kendric Ng, and you probably found this website because either:
1. You're my friend and you have some social obligation to stalk me; or
2. You've too much time on your hands and stumbled upon this site through cat GIFs.

If you didn't realise that the above was written in jest, then this blog may not be right for you. Consult your doctor.

### Objectives
All kidding aside, I'm glad that you're spending a few seconds of your precious life here. I'll update my main objectives for this site, but for now I'll list them here for you:
* A way for me to digest my thoughts and "write" them on "paper";
* A gathering for people who think like me to exchange thoughts and ideas;
* An online CV for recruiters and networkers so they can stalk me and know what I'm like before they make a mistake of working with me;
* Easy testing and deployment of business ideas (was too frustrated with Wordpress and its plugins);
* [TBD among others]

If you want to know how I built this site, or just want to have a fun guy to talk to, email me at royalmuses@gmail.com.

Welcome to my humble abode. Remember to please leave your shoes outside the door (and wear some socks, please).
