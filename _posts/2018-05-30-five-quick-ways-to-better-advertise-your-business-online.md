When a health conscious mother of two kids wants to look for the nearest organic grocery store in Nashville, what does she do? She may Google “organic food store in Birmingham” to find out. Based on this, Google will provide the most relevant search results to her.

If you own an organic grocery shop, wouldn’t you like to show up on top?

> 91.5% of organic (non-paid) Google traffic comes from the FIRST page.

That means, if your business isn’t showing up in the first page, people won’t be able to find your organic shop on Google.

You have to make sure that customers can easily find you online when they look for your product or service. And how do you do that? You need to rank higher on Google.

You don’t have to spend $10,000 on digital ads to get more people to visit your website. You don’t even have to be a Wordpress expert or a web developer. In fact, there are only **five** easy things to change on your website to get more people to find your business.

## The Swipe Right Test

If you only had your age, a picture and one paragraph to convince the person that they should talk to you (and perhaps go out on a date), how would you do it?

This analogy to Tinder is apt, as this is also how Google determines whether or not your website is the right one for their users using what’s called “The Swipe Right Test”.

Essentially, the Swipe Right Test is when Google looks at the summary of your website, your “browser metas”, and figure out if your website is what their users are searching for.

That’s why you gotta make sure your metas are what you want users to see. Make sure that they’re swiping right to your website.

## The Pretty Link Technique

www.bostonbridges.com/steelbars/HSD (also not a real link)

If you’re trying to remember where to find HSD deformed steel bars, which one would be easier to remember?

When people go to pages on your website, do they look like the former or the latter?

You need to apply the “Pretty Link Technique”. As it literally implies, you need to make links look pretty. And people will remember and know where exactly to go on your time.

## Words, words, words... and more words

If you were to guess which blog post was more relevant to the topic “world cup”, which one would it be?

1. A blog post with some mention of soccer here and there with a mention of the upcoming world cup; or
2. A mention of the roster, the countries likely to win the World Cup and lots of mention of soccer.

Probably the second one, right?

Another way Google finds out if your website is relevant is how often you mention key words, or “keywords”.

Of course, you shouldn’t just spam the word “World Cup” 100,000+ times. Google will know you’re cheating ;-)

## Title Tagging

Like with the Swipe Right Technique, this requires close attention to what your blog posts tell Google. Especially as a local business owner, you need to think about whether your website is tied to a physical address.

For instance, if you’re a local hairdresser in town giving tips on how to look like a K-pop star, users will search for “korean hairstyle (location)”. How do you make sure people find your business?

By having a relevant title and the correct location.

> Relevance (Google search) + location (Google Maps) = K-pop heaven (and Google heaven)

Starting to see how Google connects these things together for its users?

## Maps and Directories

When you go to the mall, look at the directory. Do you notice how things are organized alphabetically and according to category. If your kid wants to go to buy toy trucks and you look at the directory, I’m sure you can find it in less than a minute.

That’s how quick and useful your web directory needs to be.

If you’re selling flowers and you specialize in weddings and Valentine’s flowers, a bride-to-be needs to be able to quickly find which flowers she can pick for her wedding (and sort them out from flowers for Valentine’s Day).

Do you see a trend with these above five tweaks? Google wants its user to find what they want as best as possible. The more you can implement these tweaks, the more likely Google’s gonna think your website is relevant, and thus, rank higher and get more traffic to your site.

You can do all of this yourself, but frankly, you’ll just end up spending a lot of hours trying to figure this stuff out. Especially if you’re a busy small business owner, your time is best spent serving satisfied customers.

The good news? My friend Daniel has been helping local businesses increase traffic to their sites, and he can implement the above five tweaks in less than 24 hours!

He usually charges full consulting rates for this type of service, but for a short amount of time, he’ll be giving you a whopping 83% discount off his normal rates just so you can be convinced with what he can do.

You know how easy it is to get more traffic to your site--you have nothing to lose but your business worries.  Let Daniel rank you higher on Google and let customers find your local business a lot faster!
